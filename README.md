# Building an Autoencoder neural network with Tensorflow using MNIST database

This is an example of creating a simple neural network model of an autoencoder.
An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn data codings in an unsupervised manner. Along with the reduction side, a reconstructing side is learnt, where the autoencoder tries to generate from the reduced encoding a representation as close as possible to its original input, hence its name.
